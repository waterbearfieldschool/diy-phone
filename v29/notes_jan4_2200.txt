Great! The file debugging version is compiled. When you test this (send a message), you should see:

  🔍 Debug Output Expected:

  [THREAD DEBUG] Checking file: addressbook.txt
  [THREAD DEBUG] Checking file: sms_12345.txt
  [THREAD DEBUG] Processing SMS file: sms_12345.txt
  [THREAD DEBUG] Checking file: sms_out_76995.txt
  [THREAD DEBUG] Processing SMS file: sms_out_76995.txt

  This will help us identify:

  1. Are the sms_out_*.txt files being found? (Should see [THREAD DEBUG] Checking file: sms_out_xxxxx.txt)
  2. Are they being processed? (Should see [THREAD DEBUG] Processing SMS file: sms_out_xxxxx.txt)
  3. What's in the outgoing files? (Will show the line-by-line content)

  Based on your previous debug showing "Loaded 18 messages" but only incoming messages in the timestamp debug, I suspect the outgoing files are
  either:

  - Not being found (missing from file list)
  - Being processed but not matching the contact (recipient matching issue)
  - Being processed but parsing incorrectly (format detection problem)

  The file debug output will tell us exactly which case it is, and then we can fix the specific issue!

● Perfect! Now I can see exactly what's happening. The debug output shows:

  🔍 Key Findings:

  1. ✅ Outgoing files ARE being found and processed:
    - sms_out_34413.txt
    - sms_out_32918.txt
    - sms_out_46832.txt
    - sms_out_82219.txt
    - sms_out_35809.txt
    - And many more...
  2. ❌ But outgoing messages don't appear in the sorting debug:
    - All 5 messages in sorting are outgoing=false
    - No outgoing messages make it to the thread
  3. 📊 File count mismatch:
    - Files processed: ~20+ SMS files (including many sms_out_*.txt)
    - Messages loaded: Only 19 total, but only 5 shown in sorting debug
    - All loaded messages are incoming only

  This means outgoing files are being processed but filtered out during the contact matching phase. The issue is likely in the recipient matching
  logic.

  Let me add debug output to see why outgoing messages are being rejected:
